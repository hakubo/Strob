Small stroboscope
that uses only CSS animation

works in:
- Chrome
- Safari
- FireFox
and probably
- IE10

I couldn't get it work in Opera 12 :/

How to use it ?

Open STROBOSKOP.html
in any browser listed above
enter full screen

PARTY HARD! :)

Oh BTW you can change speed and color to fit your needs!
